.TH vz.conf 5 "16 Nov 2010" "OpenVZ" "Containers"
.SH NAME
vz.conf \- global OpenVZ configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
/etc/vz/vz.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is global configuration file for OpenVZ.
It consists of lines in the form
.PP
\fBPARAMETER\fR="\fIvalue\fR"
.PP
All parameter names and values are case-sensitive.
Quotes surrounding \fIvalue\fR are required if value contains spaces, and
are optional otherwise. Extra spaces are not allowed. All unrecognized lines
will be ignored.
.SS Global parameters
.IP \fBVIRTUOZZO\fR=\fByes\fR|\fBno\fR
This parameter can be set to \fByes\fR or \fBno\fR, and used by
\f(CW/etc/init.d/vz\fR script. In case it is not
set to \fByes\fR, nothing will be done to boot up OpenVZ on this node.
.IP "\fBLOCKDIR\fR=\fIdirectory\fR"
Set the directory to put lock files to.
.IP \fBVE0CPUUNITS\fR=\fInumber\fR
Value of this parameter sets \fBcpuunits\fR for CT0 (host system).
.IP "\fBLOGGING\fR=\fByes\fR|\fBno\fR"
Enables or disables logging. This parameter can be set to \fByes\fR or
\fBno\fR, default is \fByes\fR.
.IP \fBLOGFILE\fR=\fIfile\fR
Set location of log file, default is \f(CR/var/log/vzctl.log\fR.
.IP "\fBLOG_LEVEL\fR=\fInumber\fR"
Set the logging level. The more \fInumber\fR is, the more information will be
logged.
.IP "\fBVERBOSE\fR=\fInumber\fR"
Set the output verbosity. Default is 0.
.IP "\fBMODULES_DISABLED\fR=\fByes\fR|\fBno\fR
If the value of this parameter is set to \fByes\fR, no attempt to load
OpenVZ kernel modules is made in vz initscript. This is helpful on systems
which have OpenVZ-specific stuff compiled into the kernel (i. e. not
as modules).
.IP \fBVZFASTBOOT\fR=\fByes\fR|\fBno\fR
This parameter is used by \f(CR/etc/init.d/vz start\fR script. In case the value
of this parameter is set to \fByes\fR, all containers with incorrectly shutdown
quota state are started without quota check, and after all containers will be
started, those marked containers are restarted (to fix quotas).
.SS Network interface parameters
.IP \fBVE_ROUTE_SRC_DEV\fR="\fIdevice\fR"
This parameter specifies the network device name which IP address will be
used as the source IP. This is helpful in case more than one network
interface is configured on HN and there is a need to specify the source
IP address. Default is the first device in the network device list.
.IP \fBNEIGHBOUR_DEVS\fR[="\fBdetect\fR"]
Controls on which interfaces to add/remove ARP records for a container IP, also
which interfaces to use to query/announce ARP. If this is set to \fBdetect\fR,
the right network interface (the one which is in the same subnet as a CT IP)
will be chosen automatically. Any other value restores old (as of vzctl 3.0.19
or older) behavior, when all the possible interfaces were used.
.IP \fBERROR_ON_ARPFAIL\fR=\fByes\fR|\fBno\fR
In case the value of this parameter is set to \fByes\fR, vzctl will fail to
start a container if there is another host with the same IP in the subnet.
The value of \fBno\fR makes vzctl to only print the warning.
.IP \fBTEMPLATE\fR=\fIdirectory\fR
Value of this parameter is a directory in which all container template data are
stored.
.SS Defaults for containers
Below parameters are defaults for containers, and can be overwritten by
parameters in \fBctid.conf\fR(5) per-container configuration file.
.IP \fBDISK_QUOTA\fR=\fByes\fR|\fBno\fR
In case the value of this parameter is set to \fBno\fR, all disk
quota operations are disabled.
.IP \fBVE_ROOT\fR=\fIdirectory\fR
Value of this parameter is the \fIdirectory\fR which serves as container root
mount point. Value must contain literal string \fB$VEID\fR, which will be
substituted with the actual numeric CT ID.
.IP \fBVE_PRIVATE\fR=\fIdirectory\fR
Value of this parameter is the \fIdirectory\fR in which all the
files and directories specific to that container are stored. Value must contain
literal string \fB$VEID\fR, which will be substituted with the actual
numeric CT ID.
.IP \fBCONFIGFILE\fR=\fIname\fR
Specified default configuration file on \fBcreate\fR action, corresponds to
\fB--config\fR option.
.PP
Most of the other parameters that appear in per-container configuration files
\fBctid.conf\fR(5) can be also set here. Still, it is recommended to keep
\fBTEMPLATE\fR, \fBVE_PRIVATE\fR and \fBVE_ROOT\fR in this configuration
file, and all the other container related parameters in per-container
configuration files.
